## GNU/Linux VM Guide


In Linux, a hypervisor is a software component that enables the virtualization of hardware resources, allowing multiple operating systems (OSes) or virtual machines (VMs) to run concurrently on a single physical server or host system. The primary purpose of a hypervisor is to provide isolation and resource management between these virtual machines, making efficient use of the underlying hardware.

There are two main types of hypervisors:

1. Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-metal Hypervisor):
   - A Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the physical hardware of the host system, without requiring an underlying operating system.
   - It provides better performance and resource isolation because it has direct access to the hardware.
   - Examples of Type 1 hypervisors for Linux include Xen, KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), and VMware vSphere/ESXi.

2. Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor):
   - A Type 2 hypervisor runs on top of an existing operating system, much like any other application.
   - It is generally used for development, testing, or desktop virtualization scenarios and may not provide the same level of performance as Type 1 hypervisors.
   - Examples of Type 2 hypervisors for Linux include VirtualBox and VMware Workstation.

Here's a bit more detail on two widely used hypervisors in the Linux ecosystem:

- **Xen**: Xen is a Type 1 hypervisor that is popular in the Linux world. It allows you to run multiple VMs with different guest operating systems on a single host. Xen uses a privileged domain, called Dom0, to manage and control other virtual machines, known as DomU. It provides strong isolation between VMs and good performance.

- **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)**: KVM is a Type 1 hypervisor that is integrated into the Linux kernel. It leverages hardware virtualization extensions (such as Intel VT-x and AMD-V) to provide efficient virtualization capabilities. KVM allows you to run a wide range of guest operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and others.

Both Xen and KVM are open-source hypervisors and are commonly used in Linux server environments for hosting virtual machines and cloud computing platforms. The choice between them often depends on specific use cases, requirements, and preferences.
